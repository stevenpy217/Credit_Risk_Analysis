# Credit_Risk_Analysis


#Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. Below is the different methods used for this analysis.  
Naive Random Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling, Cluster Centroid Undersampling, SMOTEENN Sampling, Balanced Random Forest Classifying, Easy Ensemble Classifying.

Through each of these methods, I split my data into training and testing datasets, and compiled accuracy scores, confusion matries, and classification reports as my results.
